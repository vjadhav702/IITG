# IITG
Project at IITG
In this project we have created a model representing entities and relations of knowledge base.
We have used Neural Embedding approach(NTN model) to score the facts (RDF triples) of the KB and rank the facts according to the score obtained from the model.
Verified the accuracy of the neural network using MRR and HITS@10 measures.
For implementation we have used python and Theano library.
